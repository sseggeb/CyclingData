# CyclingData
My personal cycling data for analysis.

fit_file_analysis.py decompresses files exported directly from TrainingPeaks (.fit.gz files) and combines them into one dictionary.

fit_file_dashboard_graphs.py is a Dash App to select a fit file from a dropdown menu for further analysis and visualization
